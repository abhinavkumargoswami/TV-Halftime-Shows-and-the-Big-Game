# TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game

Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy in the games themselves. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The halftime shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes [riding a giant mechanical tiger](https://youtu.be/ZD1QrIe--_Y?t=14) or [leaping from the roof of the stadium](https://youtu.be/mjrdywp5nyE?t=62). In this project, you will find out how some of the elements interact with each other. * What are the most extreme game outcomes? * How does point difference affect television viewership? * How have viewership, TV ratings, and advertisement costs evolved? * Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances? The dataset used in this Project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with [game data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions), one with [TV data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_television_ratings), and one with [halftime musician data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows) for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
